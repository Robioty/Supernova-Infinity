# 🚀 Supernova: Infinity

A mobile-first planet-merging game built as a single HTML file. Drop planets, merge matching ones, chain combos, and try to reach **Vortex** — the rarest planet in the universe.

No app store required. No backend. No build step. Just one file.

---

## Playing the game

Open `index.html` in any modern mobile browser (Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS). It also works on desktop. If you're hosting on GitHub Pages, it's live the moment you push.

---

## Before publishing

Two constants at the very top of the `<script>` block need updating:

```js
const TIP_JAR_URL      = 'https://ko-fi.com/YOUR_NAME_HERE'; // your donation link
const BUG_REPORT_EMAIL = 'your@email.com';                   // your support email
```

These power the **Tip Jar** button on the home screen and the **Space Bug** reporter in the pause menu.

---

## How the game works

### Core loop
- Drag left/right to aim, lift finger to drop a planet
- Matching planets that touch **merge** into the next level up
- Chain merges quickly for **COMBO** multipliers
- Don't let planets pile past the red **danger line** — you get 7 seconds grace, then game over
- One **Near Miss Save** per run: when the grace period expires for the first time, the 3 highest planets are automatically cleared

### Planets (10 levels)
| Level | Name | Radius | Colour | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Mote | 14 | White | Star points |
| 1 | Verdis | 22 | Green | |
| 2 | Krath | 31 | Red | |
| 3 | Auroris | 41 | Gold | Striped |
| 4 | Phaedra | 53 | Purple | Striped |
| 5 | Orrath | 70 | Blue | Ringed |
| 6 | Solux | 89 | Yellow | Sun corona |
| 7 | Zephyra | 97 | Pink | Striped |
| 8 | Nullar | 118 | Black | Singularity rings |
| 9 | Vortex | 31 | Black | **Compact Black Hole** — same size as Krath, deadly mechanics (see below) |

Drop probability is **weighted by score**: early game drops are mostly Mote/Verdis/Krath. Late game opens up Auroris. There is a 3% **Lucky Drop** chance to get one level higher than normal.

### Special mechanics
| Mechanic | How it works |
|---|---|
| **HOLD** | Bank your current planet — swap it back any time, one use per drop |
| **Gravity Flip (G)** | Flips physics direction, 6-minute recharge |
| **Comet** | Flies across periodically — tap it to open the Choice Chest (Vacuum / Gravity Surge / Double Score). The comet's trail colour changes based on your last choice (red = Vacuum, gold = Gravity Surge, cyan = Double Score) |
| **Solar Wind** | Pushes all planets sideways for 30 seconds |
| **Black Hole** | Vortex (level 9) is a compact black hole (r:31). Every frame it pulls level 0/1/2 planets toward it. Every 4 seconds it consumes the nearest small planet within 120px. A faint pink dashed ring shows the capture zone. |
| **Wormhole** | Merge **two** level-9 Black Holes together and a wormhole event fires. Physics pauses briefly, all planets within 200px are consumed (200pts each), a swirling void animation plays, then it collapses and the game continues. |
| **Glitter Planet** | Rare wildcard (2% chance, unlocks at Captain rank) — upgrades whatever planet it touches by +1 level regardless of their types |
| **Accurate Drop Streak** | Drop 5 planets accurately on the ghost landing marker in a row to trigger a green particle burst and a streak counter |

### Stardust (✨)
Earned on every merge. Spend it in **Constellation** (permanent upgrades) or **Armory** (in-run power-ups).

**Constellation upgrades:**
- Stellar Recharge — gravity recharges faster (5 levels)
- Combo Flow — longer combo grace window (5 levels)
- Stardust Magnet — more stardust per merge (5 levels)
- Crisis Buffer — longer danger grace period (3 levels)
- Happy Planets 😊 — smiley faces on all planets (one-time, toggleable)
- Planet Gas 💨 — fart sound on every merge (one-time, toggleable)
- Cheeky Planets 🍑 — a cheeky bum on every planet (one-time, toggleable)

**Armory power-ups** (available from your very first game):
- **Nuke** (250✨) — removes all level 0–1 planets
- **Collapse** (600✨) — removes all level 2–3 planets
- **Seismic Pulse** (150✨) — shakes the board to unstick piled planets
- **Laser Strike** (400✨) — tap up to 3 planets (max level 4) for a spaceship to vaporise them

### Modes
| Mode | What happens to rank |
|---|---|
| Free Play | No rank change — no pressure |
| Ranked | Earn or lose RP based on score vs your tier's target |

### Rank system (10 tiers)
Cadet → Pilot → Navigator → Ace → Captain → Major → Colonel → Commander → Admiral → **Grand Admiral**

- RP is earned by beating your tier's score target, lost by falling under 50% of it
- **Rank floor**: once you reach a rank, your RP can never drop below that rank's minimum — you can't be demoted below your highest earned rank
- Tap the RANK cell on the home screen to see the full ladder with your current progress

### Tutorial
A 6-step interactive tutorial runs automatically on your very first game. It covers: dropping and aiming, merging and combos, the danger line and Near Miss Save, the gravity flip (G button) and comets, the hold slot and previews, and stardust/power-ups/ranked mode. Each step highlights the relevant part of the screen with a spotlight.

The tutorial can be replayed at any time via the **🎓 REPLAY TUTORIAL** button on the home screen.

### Achievements 🏅
12 one-time badges earned through gameplay milestones, accessible from the home screen via **🏅 ACHIEVEMENTS**. Stored in `sn_achievements`. They are:

| Badge | Title | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| 💥 | First Contact | Perform your first merge |
| 🌟 | Golden Orbit | Reach Auroris (level 3) |
| 💫 | Into the Deep | Reach Orrath (level 5) |
| 🕳️ | Event Horizon | Reach Nullar (level 8) |
| 🌀 | Singularity | Create a Vortex Black Hole |

### End-of-run stats
After every game, the **Mission Report** shows:
- Score, merges, best planet, stardust earned, best combo, run time
- A **merge chart** — horizontal bar chart showing how many merges produced each planet level, so you can see which planets dominated your run
- Ranked games also show THE CAREER card with RP change and progress to next rank

### Personal best indicator
While in-game, a faint **PB: X** label appears below the score counter showing your personal best from previous runs. It disappears once you've beaten it.
- **Daily Bonus**: +100✨ stardust each new day
- **Daily Streak**: consecutive day bonus; 7-day streak = +300✨ extra
- **Idle Stardust**: away for 2+ hours? Earn 8✨/hour (cap 150) on return
- **Daily Run**: same seeded planet sequence for all players each day — compare scores fairly

### Key design decisions worth knowing

**Physics engine**: Matter.js is torn down and rebuilt on every `startGame()` call. This is intentional — it's the cleanest way to guarantee no stale bodies or event listeners carry over between games. The alternative (clearing the world) left subtle edge cases.

**Gravity attraction**: Planets at level 3+ attract smaller nearby planets. This force is scaled down as the board fills (`gravScale` in `beforeUpdate`) and disabled entirely above 15 bodies — otherwise late-game becomes a crushing squeeze.

**Gravity rings**: The dashed circles showing a planet's attraction radius are only drawn for levels 3–8 when there are ≤10 bodies on screen. Above that, they add visual noise without useful information. Level 9 (Vortex) shows its own capture zone ring instead.

**Vortex / Black Hole design**: Vortex was shrunk from r:162 to r:31 (same as Krath) to stop it blocking the entire screen. It's now a compact black hole drawn with a black disc, pink event horizon ring, and three rotating accretion disc ellipses. Its mechanical danger comes from two behaviours: a constant per-frame gravitational pull on lvl 0/1/2 planets (applied in `beforeUpdate` alongside the normal inter-planet attraction), and a 4-second consumption timer that removes the nearest small planet within 120px. The capture radius is drawn as a faint dashed circle so players can see the threat zone.

**Wormhole event**: When two level-9 Black Holes merge, `performMerge` detects `nl >= PLANET_DATA.length` (since there is no level 10) and calls `performWormhole(x,y)` instead of spawning a new body. `performWormhole` pauses the physics engine, consumes all bodies within 200px, awards 200pts per body, and plays a 90-frame canvas animation (`drawWormhole`) consisting of expanding/contracting rings, rotating spiral arms, and a dark void gradient. Physics resumes after 1.5 seconds and the `blackHoleTimer` is cleared since both Black Holes are now gone.

**Fart sound synthesis**: Four-layer Web Audio API chain — brown noise through dual bandpass filters (the "body"), a sawtooth oscillator with pitch drop (the "raspberry"), a sub-bass sine for large planets, and a square-wave transient at the attack (the "blap"). All routed through a DynamicsCompressor for consistent volume. `ensureAudioCtx()` calls `resume()` before every sound to handle Chrome's autoplay policy on mobile.

**AudioContext**: Created lazily on first sound, then reused. `ensureAudioCtx()` always calls `resume()` first — Chrome suspends the context until a user gesture, and merge events fire from physics callbacks rather than directly from taps.

**Daily Run fairness**: Uses mulberry32 — a deterministic seeded PRNG — seeded from `new Date().toDateString()`. Every player on the same calendar day gets identical planet sequences, making score comparison fair.

**Power-up unlocks**: Gated on `totalGamesEver()` (persisted in `sn_v10.totalGames`) rather than the session `gamesPlayed` counter. This means they stay unlocked after page reload once the threshold is crossed.

**Achievements**: Stored as an object in `sn_achievements` mapping achievement ID to earned timestamp. `earnAchievement(id)` is idempotent — calling it on an already-earned badge is a no-op. `checkAchievements()` is called at the end of every run via `gameOver()` and evaluates all run-based conditions at once. Some achievements (glitter merge, wormhole) are earned at the moment they happen rather than waiting for end-of-run.

**Merge chart**: `_sMergesByLevel` is a 10-element array reset at the start of each game. Both `performMerge` and `performGlitterMerge` increment `_sMergesByLevel[nl]`. At end-of-run, `showEndScreen` uses the array to build a normalised bar chart where the widest bar = 100% and other bars are proportional. Planets with zero merges are omitted.

**Accurate drop streak**: On every drop, the pointerup handler records `dropX` and calls `calcGhostY(dropX, isFlipped)` to get the predicted landing Y. 400ms later (after the planet has started falling), a `setTimeout` checks if any body of the dropped level is within 2× the planet's radius of the predicted landing position. This is a loose check — it rewards intent without requiring pixel-perfect precision.

**Personal best indicator**: The `pb-label` div sits inside the top bar score wrapper and shows the stored `sn_v10.best` on game start. It's hidden when the game is not in progress and auto-hides when the player beats their best (the `flashNewBest` animation serves as the signal).

### Critical patterns to know
- **PLANET_DATA[9]** = Vortex (blackhole:true, r:31) — no smiley/bum/skin overlays
- **PLANET_DATA[8]** = Nullar (singularity:true) — no smiley/bum overlays, skin OK
- **cosmeticIds** in showConstellation: `['happy_faces','fart_sounds','cheeky_bum','skin_rainbow','skin_fire','skin_ice','skin_neon','skin_galaxy','skin_gold']`
- **activeSkin()** returns first toggled-on purchased skin from SKIN_IDS array
- **anTrack(event, value?)** — wraps in try/catch, never throws
- **All boots** end with `checkPilotName()` call
- **gameOver** calls `checkAchievements()` then `ppEndTurn(score)` if ppActive, else showEndScreen
- **performMerge** intercepts nl>=PLANET_DATA.length → performWormhole()
- **beforeUpdate** hook applies BH pull force + anomaly
- **afterRender** hook draws ghost, danger line, particles, comet, laser, wormhole anim, planets, BH rings
